      <description>The windows desktop has (had? I don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention) icons labeled &amp;ldquo;My Computer&amp;rdquo;. I always thought that was odd, or at least very often out of context as many (most?) instances of Windows ran on machines at people&amp;rsquo;s jobs. They didn&amp;rsquo;t own the computer. It was not &amp;ldquo;My Computer&amp;rdquo;.
Similarly, Apple has a long history of asserting they know what&amp;rsquo;s best for other people and their computers. The last time I had to go to &amp;ldquo;The Apple Store&amp;rdquo; all I wanted was a power cable.</description>

      <title>Poetry in the trash</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, my mother went through the effects of her cousin
after she died.  It turns out Thelma Jane wrote poetry.  Nobody knew.
It wound up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thelma lived alone.  Her husband had died in his 40s.  They had no
children. Her mother, my great-aunt Bess, lived to 102 and took her
first motorcycle ride at 100.  My mom had to go through Thelma&amp;rsquo;s stuff
and Aunt Bess&amp;rsquo; stuff, most of which Thelma still had.  I now have some
of the leftovers.  But nobody wanted the poetry.  So it&amp;rsquo;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the question this article explores: &lt;em&gt;why write&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
