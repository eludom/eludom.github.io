      <title>Adding uncertainty in uncertain times</title>

      <description>So, when life turns uncertain you have two choices. Cling to things that seem to add stability and certainty, i.e. try to &amp;ldquo;stay safe&amp;rdquo;, or embrace the uncertainty, live now, carpe diem, and do things would seem to be fulfilling now.
I&amp;rsquo;m choosing the latter. At 58, in the middle of a pandemic and social unrest, I&amp;rsquo;m moving to a startup. The following are notes from a friend who has been playing the silicon valley startup game for a few decades.</description>

      <title>Thoughts on the OODA loop and falling out of a canoe</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/posts/ooda-loop-and-getting-wet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my never ending quest for synthesis, this post combines thoughts on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA%5Floop&#34;&gt;the OODA loop&lt;/a&gt; and falling out of a canoe twice this weekend in rapids
on the Shenandoah river.  There is a connection.  Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the full trip report, pictures, etc. go here &lt;a href=&#34;https://eludom.github.io/blog/get-wet/&#34;&gt;Things
that fall in the river get wet&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in how this relates to
the OODA loop or, better, if you have experience/thoughts on applying
the OODA loop to operational cybersecurity settings, read on (and
comment !)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>My Computer ?</title>

      <description>The windows desktop has (had? I don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention) icons labeled &amp;ldquo;My Computer&amp;rdquo;. I always thought that was odd, or at least very often out of context as many (most?) instances of Windows ran on machines at people&amp;rsquo;s jobs. They didn&amp;rsquo;t own the computer. It was not &amp;ldquo;My Computer&amp;rdquo;.
Similarly, Apple has a long history of asserting they know what&amp;rsquo;s best for other people and their computers. The last time I had to go to &amp;ldquo;The Apple Store&amp;rdquo; all I wanted was a power cable.</description>

      <title>Choosy Programmers Choose GIF</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve%5FWilhite&#34;&gt;Steve Wilhite&lt;/a&gt; is the most prolific programmer I&amp;rsquo;ve ever known.  He&amp;rsquo;s
mostly remembered for creating &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gif&#34;&gt;GIF&lt;/a&gt; but he spent 30 years writing piles
of amazing software which helped set the stage for the Web.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Poetry in the trash</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/posts/poetry-in-the-trash/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, my mother went through the effects of her cousin
after she died.  It turns out Thelma Jane wrote poetry.  Nobody knew.
It wound up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thelma lived alone.  Her husband had died in his 40s.  They had no
children. Her mother, my great-aunt Bess, lived to 102 and took her
first motorcycle ride at 100.  My mom had to go through Thelma&amp;rsquo;s stuff
and Aunt Bess&amp;rsquo; stuff, most of which Thelma still had.  I now have some
of the leftovers.  But nobody wanted the poetry.  So it&amp;rsquo;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the question this article explores: &lt;em&gt;why write&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
