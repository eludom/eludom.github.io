<p>From Sunday 2020-09-06 to Saturday 2020-09-12 I hiked 82 miles
SOBO on the Appalachian Trail from Bennington, VT (VT 9) to
Great Barrington, Mass (Mass 23).  Highlights (high point) of
the trip included Mt. Greylock, the highest point in Mass, the
lovely town campsite in Cheshire, Mass, Camping by a beaver dam
Sunday night and seeing Moose in the morning, lots of beaver
dams/bogs, staying 2 nights (Thursday, Saturday before driving
home) at the Berkshire Lakeside Lodge, a lovely little motel .2
off the trail, and, of course, lots of hiking and people.
Resupply in Dalton, Mass at the Post Office.  Chocolate shake
and meatball grinder in Cheshire.  Pizza and milk in Dalton.
Magic coming down to 20 Thursday in the most-of-the day rain.
The weather, except for Thursday rain, was excellent.  Upper 50s
to lower 80s.</p>
<p>Pre-trip I stopped at a Legend Of Sleepy Hollow/Rip Van Winkle
site, and just down the road the Martin Van Buren home, a short
hike in Philmont (!), NY to a high waterfall that people were
swimming under, saw some wild turkeys.  Stayed at the Days Inn
in Great Barrington and got a shuttle Sunday morning from Debbie
Andrus</p>
<p>Post trip, I went back to the Berkshire Lakeside Lodge.  I&rsquo;d
spent time in the area.  Normal Rockwell museum.  Lakes.
Tanglewood music festival (Boston Symphony summer series).
Shaker village (I camped at the &ldquo;&ldquo;Shaker Campsite&rdquo;&quot;).  West
Stockbridge is a lovely little town.  It has the &ldquo;&ldquo;TurnPark&rdquo;&quot;,
an outdoor interactive art park where I met one of the artists
(cutting the weeds).  Good food.  Probably expensive and crowded
in a non-COVID high season.  &quot;</p>
<h2 id="7-3-7-4-2020-davenport-gap-to-hot-springs">7/3-7/4/2020	Davenport Gap to Hot Springs</h2>

<p>Breakfast at diner. Shuttle to I-40.  Lost 1 - 1.5 hours because
shuttle driver (NYC guy) was a slave to his GPS, would not just
hop on 40.  On trail at 10.  Made it to Max Patch about 6.  UP
HILL.  I was shot.  July 3 on the summit was a mob scene.  I
camped 1/2 mile short.  Tried cold dinner (mashed potatoes +
stuffing + chicken).  Meh. Went up for sunset, and again just
after sunrise.  Bueatiful. Hiked 21 back into Hot Springs.
Hiked a little way with 2 girls from Tucker/Stone Mountain, GA
(where my wife went to school). Hit town.  Liquid.  Shower.
DROVE to store.  White Castles.  Bed.  Drove home.  %65.1 of
trail done.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mountian Squid&rdquo; joined me for the first 3 miles.  Ran into 2
older Russian couples who were out for the first time.  Hiked
with the owner of <a href="https://www.flowmarshall.com/">https://www.flowmarshall.com/</a> gallary in
Marshall, NC and her British husband for a bit.  Stayed at Uncle
Johnnies 1st night, shuttled to Hughs Gap.  Stayed at Uncle
Johhnies 3rd night, resupplied, hiked on to Hot Springs.  20
into hot springs from Laurel Fork.  Zeroed at Laughing Heart
hostle, shuttled back to Irwin to get car, drove, car broke down
in Wythville (axel), rented a car, came home, started a new job,
went back to Wythville Wednesday night.  Got car Thursday drove
back to Hot Springs_Laughing Heart, run by &ldquo;Chuck Norris&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Tigger&rdquo; &hellip; former Jesuit retreat center_hostel.  Great place.
Got food in Hot Springs hiking in.  Big hill/rock steps coming
down.</p>
