<dt>Dialup BBS Systems</dt>
<dd>Once upon a time it was illegal to connect
modems (or anything else but AT&amp;T equipment) to the phone network.
And that was, basically, the only network.  Some time after that
changed, dialup Bullitin Board Systems (BBS) arrived.  You could
dial up and connect to a BBS running in someone&rsquo;s house often
connected to the only line (the home phone).  Mom and Dad may have
wondered at first why they picked up a call and heard awful
electronic squawking noises rather than someone saying &ldquo;Hello&rdquo;.
Once on, you could leave messages, read messages, etc.  Communities
formed this way.</dd>
<dt>TOPS-20 Bulletin Boards</dt>
<dd>I&rsquo;m not sure, but my first exposure
to bulletin boards and email (&ldquo;social media&rdquo;) was probably on
the Ohio State DecSystem-20.  I had friends who worked there,
and we later went to school there and thus had a &ldquo;legitimate&rdquo;
accounts.  The world and software I remember is describe well
here <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/dec20.html">http://www.columbia.edu/kermit/dec20.html</a>.  Kermit (the
project that the authors of this article ran) was a very
important piece of software for 10-15 years, a workhorse of
moving files across dial-up phone connections.</dd>
<dt>Usenet News</dt>
<dd>Social media c.a. 1980.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usenet">Usenet</a> was (is) a system
that moves messages (posts) between connected computers.  In the
beginning this was dial-up lines.  Mostly between universities and
research institutions and, of course, AT&amp;T/Bell Labs etc.  For a
while the USENET &ldquo;backbone&rdquo; (the long haul links, the well connected
sites) were run by an unofficial cabal internally at AT&amp;T (because
they had free access to &ldquo;long lines&rdquo;) and traffic was farmed out to
local sites (universities) for further distribution.  It was the
quintessential &ldquo;old boy&rdquo; network.  To connect, you had to know
someone and convince them to &ldquo;give you a feed&rdquo;.  I was on sometime
from the mid-80s on. A few ?representative? newsgroups: <code>comp.sources.amiga</code>,
<code>rec.humor.funny</code> <code>alt.ensign.wesley.die.die.die</code></dd>
<dt>CompuServe: Dialup+Network+Dec10s == Information Service</dt>
<dd>CompuServe
(&ldquo;Online Services&rdquo;) was born in this world.  People started having
&ldquo;Personal Computers&rdquo; in the late 70s and early 80s.  Modems started
becoming a thing.  While Usenet, BBS systems, Fido-net and friends
started using these technologies to connect people in non-commercial
settings, Compu$erve started to do so in a commercial setting.
CompuServe had been running a nationwide packet switching network
since 1972 (take that, ARPANET !), had been selling business
oriented computing services, and time sharing on its DecSystem10&rsquo;s
accessed via that network as well as growing raft of dial-up modem
pools, conveniently located in H&amp;R Block offices around the country
at a time when having &ldquo;Local&rdquo; numbers was important (long distance
was expensive).  This was the 1970s version of &ldquo;Cloud Computing&rdquo;.
Business use slacked off at night, so what was a good time-sharing
company to do?  Why start an Information Service that grew into the
familiar lineup of &ldquo;Forums&rdquo; (BBS), &ldquo;InfoPlex&rdquo; (email), &ldquo;CB&rdquo;
(chat/Aim/IRC), and the recurring services that every online service,
search engine and social network eventually devolves to: News,
Weather, and Sports.  I think the online service started around 1980.   I began working
there in 1985.   More from the CompuPerspective as these posts
progress.</dd>
