<p>I recently picked up a copy of <a href="http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/republic.8.vii.html">Plato&rsquo;s allegory of &ldquo;The Cave&rdquo;</a>.  I had
known some of the highlights of the story before, the shadows on the
wall, prisoners thinking that the shadows were reality, since that&rsquo;s

<p>But I had not known the context until reading the original.  He was
talking about the need for rulers of the state to have a higher
vision, to have a view of truth, of the transcendent, to willingly
leave the ivory tower, the &ldquo;Isle of the blessed&rdquo; if you will, where
they desired to spend their whole life in contemplation of the truth,
and to willingly go back into the cave to enlighten their brethren and
lead with a knowldge of truth, not desiring the mundane (and false)
trappings of the world of shadows (power, wealth, leisure, goods) for
their own sake and for their own use.  Rulers who do not have that
vision, and who only focus on this life are bad rulers, and everyone
(including the rulers) loose out.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whereas the truth is that the State in which the rulers are most
reluctant to govern [because they would rather be engaged in
philosophical pursuits] is always the best and most quietly governed,
and the State in which they are most eager, the worst.
&hellip;</p>
<p>Yes, my friend, I said; and there lies the point. You must contrive
for your future rulers another and a better life than that of a ruler,
and then you may have a well-ordered State; for only in the State
which offers this, will they rule who are truly rich, not in silver
and gold, but in virtue and wisdom, which are the true blessings of
life. Whereas if they go to the administration of public affairs, poor
and hungering after their own private advantage, thinking that hence
they are to snatch the chief good, order there can never be; for they
will be fighting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which
thus arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole
State.  &mdash; Plato, Republic, 8.vii</p>
