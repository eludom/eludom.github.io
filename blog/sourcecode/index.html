<dl>
<dt>Print Outs</dt>
<dd>Paper.  Yes, paper.  My first memories of source
code (late 70s) include source listing of BASIC programs
printed on ASR-33 Teletypes.  I also have memories of a large
stack of &ldquo;green bar&rdquo; printouts at home (again, c.a. 78 or 79)
that I think where the printouts of Emacs (TECO emacs, the
original, before GNU) that my brother probably brought home
from Carnegie-Mellon where he went as an undergrad.</dd>
<dt>Paper Tape</dt>
<dd>The ASR-33s had paper tape punches on the side.
You could punch your programs onto tape and read them back in.
It was 8-bit ASCII.   At one point, I think my brother could
read the ASCII by looking at the tape.</dd>
<dt>Cards</dt>
<dd>Early in college (80, 81) I actually punched cards for
a class or two.  You could duplicate cards.   No cheating on
that programming assignment now !</dd>
<dt>BYTE Magazine</dt>
<dd>Gamers of yore bought BYTE Magazine (and
others), in part to get the source code listings that they
could then type in.</dd>
<dt>ACM, Knuth</dt>
<dd>And of course there were textbooks such as Kunths
(to this day unfinished) &ldquo;The Art of Computer Programming&rdquo; and
ACM publications.  Steve Wilhite used an algorithm published in
ACM as part of GIF&hellip;of course anything printed was in the
public domain, right? &hellip; well, no.  We were all still learning
about and in some cases defining the legal status of software
then, right along with GNU/FSF.</dd>
</dl>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<dl>
<dt>USENET News</dt>
<dd>In the late 80s, MIT project Athena periodically posted
the source code to X-Windows to the USENET news group
comp.sources.x.  If you were on a USENET site that &ldquo;took a
feed&rdquo; of that newsgroup (usually over modems not faster than
9600baud), to get the latest source to X, you watched the news
group (using readnews, rn or some other &ldquo;newsreader&rdquo; program),
saved off the individual pieces from each post, reassembled and
then extracted the code.  The (large) distro was compressed and
broken up into many pieces, and re-assembling them often
involved the use of uudecode, shar, patch, tar, and programs to
decompress (pretty sure gzip was not a thing yet).  Of course,
you had to grab them before your news site expired the articles
(spool space was limited, and space was shared with
rec.humor.funny and other essential news groups).  Heaven help
you if you missed one piece.  No bit-torrent for you to find
the missing pieces.  You got one shot from one source in a
limited time window.</dd>
<dt>UUCP</dt>
<dd>UUCP being &ldquo;unix to unix copy&rdquo;, you could literally
issue a copy command of source known to live on a remote system
something like
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">            uucp cbosgd!/archive/hdb-uucp.tar.gz hdb-uucp.tar.gz
</code></pre></div><p>with multi-hop paths being possible&hellip;if you knew the topology
(pathalias !) and the filenames.</p>
</dd>
<dt>mag tape</dt>
<dd>Then there was the time I was in Boston (visiting
Encore computer?).   I took a blank 9-track tape, arranged to
stop by MIT, was given a personal tour of the labs, show the
locked room where the all-important KDC (forerunner of
Microsoft&rsquo;s domain controllers) was kept, and got a copy of the
latest Athena source (X, Kerberos, Hesiod, etc.) dumped to
tape. This was getting software, the easy way.</dd>
<dt>DECUS tapes</dt>
<dd>Tapes were a thing for quite a while.  early on
users of DEC computers created and distributed &ldquo;decus tapes&rdquo;,
which were user-contributed collections of software.  If the
VAX/VMS bulletin board system I created in FORTRAN-77 around
1983 exists anywhere in the world, it&rsquo;s probably in the archive
of DECUS tapes.  This is one example of collections of
user-generated software that grew into the software archives we
came to know later.  I think the IBM SHARE user group had
similar collections.  The programs (games, etc) distributed
with BSD Unix formed another set.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DistroWatch">DistroWatch</a> is one web site
in this vein today.</dd>
<dt>Floppies</dt>
<dd>With the advent of the PC (early, mid 80s) floppies
became a thing.  I purchased a copy of the Mark Williams C
compiler for DOS just to get the public-domain source to
MicroEmacs which I then ported to the Amiga.  Of course, with
floppies came boot sector viruses and the security wars were
on.  Later issues of BYTE sometimes shipped with floppies of
source so you didn&rsquo;t have to type it in.</dd>
<dt>Email</dt>
<dd>Yes, you could always use tar, shar(1), uuencode(1)
and friends to email source code.   Email has been a workhorse
for something like 40 years, not just for communication but as
the file transfer method of last (first?) resort.</dd>
<dt>CompuServe (and other) Forums</dt>
<dd>I ran (&ldquo;SYSOPed&rdquo; the
CompuServe Unix Forum for a few years.  I think we/I may have
invented the file suffix &ldquo;.tgz&rdquo; to stand for &ldquo;gzip tar&rdquo; archive
(because the forums could not deal with multiple suffixes, as
in .tar.gz).  We had source code available for download.  The
Forums were just CompuServe&rsquo;s version of the local dial-up BBS
and many other similar message/download systems.</dd>
<dt>FTP</dt>
<dd>As Internet connectivity started becoming common (at
least in universities, government and some larger
corporations), a number of &ldquo;well known&rdquo; FTP sites where created
(often at well connected UUCP sites) that collected and offered
source downloads. UUNET and WUSTL (Washington Univerity at
St. Louis) being some of the larger ones (there is still a
version of FTP server software, wu-ftp available for Linux)</dd>
<dt>Source Code Control Systems</dt>
<dd>As Internet connectivity became
a thing, source code control systems such as cvs, svn,
mercurial and friends started being used on local networks and
it became possible to use them over the Internet.  They also
solved a lot of the collaboration, version control and release
management issues that are important for projects of any size.</dd>
<dt>SourceForge</dt>
<dd>Sourceforge gets honorable mention as a
precursor to github and friends.  In the early 2000s it hosted
many open source projects.  I initially hosted NCAT there which
became the Center for Internet Security&rsquo;s Router Audit Tool.</dd>
<dt>&ldquo;My name is Legion, for we are many&rdquo;</dt>
<dd>Git is a good thing.
Really.  Today we have github, gitlab, dropbox and thousands of
other options for getting and sharing source code, some of
which even work reasonably well.</dd>
</dl>
<p>The world has changed. It really is a better place. No more
trolling the USENET News feed spool.  No more trips to MIT, tape
in hand.  No more hoping ftp.uu.net has the latest version.
Go forth and hack.</p>
