<p>I recently went backpacking on the Appalachian Trail in Massachusetts.
One of the reasons I go out is to &ldquo;get away&rdquo;, to go &ldquo;off the grid&rdquo;, to
enjoy nature and get away from adds, trackers, social media, etc.</p>
<p>But a funny thing happened at my last campsite.  There was a camera
strapped to a tree taking my picture every time I put my food in or
out of the &ldquo;bear box&rdquo;.  The sign on the camera, in addition to asking

<p>In addition to that, many hikers now use the &ldquo;<a href="https://atlasguides.com/?cn-reloaded=1">Guthook</a>&rdquo; app to track
their progress, find distance to water, etc.  It has social media-like
features that let you leave messages to help other hikers like &ldquo;there
is a good stealth campsite at this stream&hellip;&quot;.  And such comments
suggesting helpful, but sometimes over the official line actions,
which are absolutely not being monitored by park officials (looking at
you Smokies, Baxter) and others concerned with keeping everyone
strictly in line with the mountains of rules made by people sitting at
desks who have NOT just hiked 8 to 12 hours a day for days on end and
have no appreciation of or sympathy for realities in the field.</p>
<p>Mind you, I&rsquo;m all for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leave%5FNo%5FTrace">Leave No Trace</a>, minimizing impact, ensuring that
others have the same opportunities I crave to enjoy nature, not
killing cute little animals out of sheer cruelty, etc, but&hellip;</p>
<pre><code class="language-nil" data-lang="nil">&quot;Signs, signs, everywhere there's signs,
blocking out the scenery, blowing my mind,
saying 'Do this, don't do that'
Can't you read the signs?&quot;
