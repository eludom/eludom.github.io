      <title>Thoughts on the OODA loop and falling out of a canoe</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/ooda-loop-and-getting-wet/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In my never ending quest for synthesis, this post combines thoughts on
&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OODA%5Floop&#34;&gt;the OODA loop&lt;/a&gt; and falling out of a canoe twice this weekend in rapids
on the Shenandoah river.  There is a connection.  Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to see the full trip report, pictures, etc. go here &lt;a href=&#34;https://eludom.github.io/blog/get-wet/&#34;&gt;Things
that fall in the river get wet&lt;/a&gt;.  If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in how this relates to
the OODA loop or, better, if you have experience/thoughts on applying
the OODA loop to operational cybersecurity settings, read on (and
comment !)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bear attacks, no-win situations and cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/cybersecurity-and-bears/</link>

      <description>I spend a good amount of time hiking in Shenandoah National Park and surrounding areas. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen quite a few #bears and I&amp;rsquo;ve followed one down the trail. I&amp;rsquo;ve been growled at by a mother bear when I unknowingly came between her and her cubs. This is going somewhere related to #cybersecurity. I promise.
You can&amp;rsquo;t outrun a bear. Climbing a tree won&amp;rsquo;t help. If a bear actually decides to attack you, the odds are not in your favor, but fortunately they almost never attack.</description>

      <title>â€‹Reproducible security analytics?</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/reproducable-security-analytics/</link>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m looking for repositories of &amp;ldquo;reproducible security analytics&amp;rdquo;.
As an addict of Emacs Org mode, one of the papers that got me started thinking along these lines was A Multi-Language Computing Environment for Literate Programming and Reproducible Research. I realize for most of the rest of the world this vision is now realized more in things like Jupyter and Zeppelin notebooks. Your loss :-)
One thing that looks promising is mitre&amp;rsquo;s cyber analytics repository.</description>
