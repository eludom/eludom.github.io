      <description>I spend a good amount of time hiking in Shenandoah National Park and surrounding areas. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen quite a few #bears and I&amp;rsquo;ve followed one down the trail. I&amp;rsquo;ve been growled at by a mother bear when I unknowingly came between her and her cubs. This is going somewhere related to #cybersecurity. I promise.
You can&amp;rsquo;t outrun a bear. Climbing a tree won&amp;rsquo;t help. If a bear actually decides to attack you, the odds are not in your favor, but fortunately they almost never attack.</description>

      <title>â€‹Reproducible security analytics?</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m looking for repositories of &amp;ldquo;reproducible security analytics&amp;rdquo;.
As an addict of Emacs Org mode, one of the papers that got me started thinking along these lines was A Multi-Language Computing Environment for Literate Programming and Reproducible Research. I realize for most of the rest of the world this vision is now realized more in things like Jupyter and Zeppelin notebooks. Your loss :-)
One thing that looks promising is mitre&amp;rsquo;s cyber analytics repository.</description>
