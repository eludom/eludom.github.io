      <description>The windows desktop has (had? I don&amp;rsquo;t pay attention) icons labeled &amp;ldquo;My Computer&amp;rdquo;. I always thought that was odd, or at least very often out of context as many (most?) instances of Windows ran on machines at people&amp;rsquo;s jobs. They didn&amp;rsquo;t own the computer. It was not &amp;ldquo;My Computer&amp;rdquo;.
Similarly, Apple has a long history of asserting they know what&amp;rsquo;s best for other people and their computers. The last time I had to go to &amp;ldquo;The Apple Store&amp;rdquo; all I wanted was a power cable.</description>

lurking under the hood.  &amp;ldquo;Its complicated.&amp;rdquo;  This is the story of
understanding, debugging and fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
