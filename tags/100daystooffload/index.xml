      <description>Experiences after 9 days of blogging About 3 weeks ago I decided to start blogging. For various still ill-defined reasons, some of which I explored in a blog post contemplating the fate of writing and writers great and small But it&amp;rsquo;s still somewhat mushy.
I spent some time coming up the curve on the Hugo framework for building static web sites and the emacs org mode counterpart ox-hugo which let me put up my Curious Musings blog.</description>

      <description>Getting started in life is harder right now. I have two college age sons who both just finished up their year with online classes, and both are home now. In &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; times they would be working summer jobs or participating in other activities that would help them advance toward their chosen careers. Jobs may or may not happen. Even getting out of the house may not happen much. These are weird times.</description>
