      <description>Getting started in life is harder right now. I have two college age sons who both just finished up their year with online classes, and both are home now. In &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; times they would be working summer jobs or participating in other activities that would help them advance toward their chosen careers. Jobs may or may not happen. Even getting out of the house may not happen much. These are weird times.</description>
