      <description>So yesterday I got out and walked up the 2.5 miles/900 foot rise of the section of the Appalachian Trail form VA-55 to the Manassas Gap shelter. It reminded me that you really do have to do serious workout to stay in shape. I had been going for 1 or 2 hour walks around the house (flat), but it became clear, that even on that short &amp;ldquo;easy&amp;rdquo; walk it was not enough.</description>
