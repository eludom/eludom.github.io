      <description>Experiences after 9 days of blogging About 3 weeks ago I decided to start blogging. For various still ill-defined reasons, some of which I explored in a blog post contemplating the fate of writing and writers great and small But it&amp;rsquo;s still somewhat mushy.
I spent some time coming up the curve on the Hugo framework for building static web sites and the emacs org mode counterpart ox-hugo which let me put up my Curious Musings blog.</description>

      <title>Poetry in the trash</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, my mother went through the effects of her cousin
after she died.  It turns out Thelma Jane wrote poetry.  Nobody knew.
It wound up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thelma lived alone.  Her husband had died in his 40s.  They had no
children. Her mother, my great-aunt Bess, lived to 102 and took her
first motorcycle ride at 100.  My mom had to go through Thelma&amp;rsquo;s stuff
and Aunt Bess&amp;rsquo; stuff, most of which Thelma still had.  I now have some
of the leftovers.  But nobody wanted the poetry.  So it&amp;rsquo;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the question this article explores: &lt;em&gt;why write&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
