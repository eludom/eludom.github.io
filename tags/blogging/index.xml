      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;experiences-after-9-days-of-blogging&#34;&gt;Experiences after 9 days of blogging&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 3 weeks ago I decided to start blogging.  For various still
ill-defined reasons, some of which I explored in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://eludom.github.io/blog/poetry-in-the-trash/&#34;&gt;blog post
contemplating the fate of writing and writers great and small&lt;/a&gt;.
But it&amp;rsquo;s still somewhat mushy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent some time coming up the curve on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gohugo.io/&#34;&gt;Hugo framework for
building static web sites&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/&#34;&gt;emacs org mode counterpart ox-hugo&lt;/a&gt;
which let me put up my &lt;a href=&#34;https://eludom.github.io/&#34;&gt;Curious Musings&lt;/a&gt; blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The a few days after that on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fosstodon.org/web/timelines/home&#34;&gt;Fosstodon&lt;/a&gt; (open source distributed social
media) I came across the &lt;a href=&#34;https://100daystooffload.com/&#34;&gt;https://100daystooffload.com/&lt;/a&gt; challenge
which, basically encourages you to &amp;ldquo;just write&amp;rdquo;.   Good timing.
Here it is.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Poetry in the trash</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, my mother went through the effects of her cousin
after she died.  It turns out Thelma Jane wrote poetry.  Nobody knew.
It wound up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thelma lived alone.  Her husband had died in his 40s.  They had no
children. Her mother, my great-aunt Bess, lived to 102 and took her
first motorcycle ride at 100.  My mom had to go through Thelma&amp;rsquo;s stuff
and Aunt Bess&amp;rsquo; stuff, most of which Thelma still had.  I now have some
of the leftovers.  But nobody wanted the poetry.  So it&amp;rsquo;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the question this article explores: &lt;em&gt;why write&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;
