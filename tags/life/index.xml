      <description>What is this and who is it for? This is written primarily as a personal reflection to my cousin about us both winding up with tons of family &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;. Secondarily it is intended for a family newsletter. Tertiarily, for my sons to document snippets of family history, and lastly (quarternarily ?) it is written as an &amp;ldquo;open letter&amp;rdquo;.
To John You and I both have a lot of &amp;ldquo;family stuff&amp;rdquo;, for different reasons I think.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And to get away from it all tonight we played (well, continued) a game
of Civilization: Famine, Strife, Civil War, Flood,
Earthquakes, Volcanoes, but strangely no epidemic (yet).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting started in life is harder right now</title>

      <description>Getting started in life is harder right now. I have two college age sons who both just finished up their year with online classes, and both are home now. In &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; times they would be working summer jobs or participating in other activities that would help them advance toward their chosen careers. Jobs may or may not happen. Even getting out of the house may not happen much. These are weird times.</description>

      <title>Poetry in the trash</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/poetry-in-the-trash/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, my mother went through the effects of her cousin
after she died.  It turns out Thelma Jane wrote poetry.  Nobody knew.
It wound up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thelma lived alone.  Her husband had died in his 40s.  They had no
children. Her mother, my great-aunt Bess, lived to 102 and took her
first motorcycle ride at 100.  My mom had to go through Thelma&amp;rsquo;s stuff
and Aunt Bess&amp;rsquo; stuff, most of which Thelma still had.  I now have some
of the leftovers.  But nobody wanted the poetry.  So it&amp;rsquo;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the question this article explores: &lt;em&gt;why write&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Digital chimney smoke?</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/digital-chimney-smoke/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Boone is quoted (via Hubert Humphrey) as saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when he could see the smoke from another chimney, felt himself too
crowded and moved further out into the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Twain said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All is not doom and gloom: go for a walk !!!</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/go-for-a-walk/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I find that when I stay glued to twitter (pick your
social-media-of-doom-amplifier) I tend to get a rather gloomy view of
life.  There is indeed a lot one can be gloomy about these days.  But
if you just go for a walk and look around you may be
surprised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this art &lt;a href=&#34;#org88f3289&#34;&gt;sidewalk art&lt;/a&gt; at just about the exact place where last
fall I had purchased a cup of lemonade from 4 eager young
entrepreneurs.  I suspect the ring leader of that optimistic young
bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
