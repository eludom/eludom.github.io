      <description>Jeff Bezos is stepping down as CEO of Amazon Monday. I met him briefly at an internal company conference (the Amazon Machine Learning conference) when I worked there 2016.
   Figure 1: Jeff Bezos  I admire him. He&amp;rsquo;s created things. He built a company that&amp;rsquo;s changing the world. He had vision. He (and his in-laws) took risks. He provided leadership (see the The Amazon Leadership Principals) and he knew when to get out of the way.</description>

      <title>What a day for a daydream</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/dream-on/</link>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Ladies and Gentlemen, may I have your attention&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;
 This piece began as some thoughts on &amp;ldquo;attention&amp;rdquo; and wound up as reflections on daydreams. I think I&amp;rsquo;m a fan of daydreaming.
Attention Attention is a finite commodity. You only have so much attention to give in your life, in your day. Parents want your attention. Brothers and sisters and friends want your attention. Teachers want your attention. Employers want your attention.</description>

      <title>Nixon&#39;s The One !!!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;For those who remember the &amp;ldquo;All in the family&amp;rdquo; sitcom:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mister, we could use a man like Richard Nixon again&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;figure&gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://eludom.github.io/ox-hugo/nixon.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Figure 1: &amp;ldquo;Richard Nixon&amp;rdquo; by History In An Hour is licensed under CC BY 2.0&#34; width=&#34;200px&#34;/&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;
                
                &lt;p&gt;
                    Figure 1: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/51878367@N02/4775027305&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;Richard Nixon&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/51878367@N02&#34;&gt;History In An Hour&lt;/a&gt; is licensed under &lt;a href=&#34;https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0/?ref=ccsearch&amp;amp;atype=html&#34;&gt;CC BY 2.0&lt;/a&gt;

            &lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Richard Nixon lost the 1960 election to John F. Kennedy in the closest
(popular) election of the 20th century.  There was a credible case to
be made that voting irregularities in Chicago (read, the Richard Daley
political machine) and Texas put Kennedy over the top (in the electoral
college).  And yet&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>History: escape to the past or lessons for the present?</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/why-history/</link>

      <guid>https://eludom.github.io/blog/why-history/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked history.  And because the un-examined predilection
is not worth having (γνῶθι σεαυτόν), I turn to Livy to understand it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This I hold to be the chief value and reward of history, to have
examples of all kinds set forth as an illustrious record, from which
you may choose what is worthy of imitation in public and private life,
and what is to be shunned as wrong in inception and ruinous in outcome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Livy, Preface to History of Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quoted from &amp;ldquo;Classics In Translation: Volume II, Latin Literature&amp;rdquo;,
MacKendrick and Howe, 1982&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, history provides examples for present living.  It provides a moral
and practical purpose, helping to guide our interactions with others
in the present, but also&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Joy in the sorrows of others?</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/joy-in-sorrow/</link>

      <guid>https://eludom.github.io/blog/joy-in-sorrow/</guid>
      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Why is it that man desires to be made sad, beholding miserable and
tragic things which he himself would by no means wish to suffer?  Yet
he desires as a spectator to feel sorrow, and this sorrow is his pleasure&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Was this guy watching too much news, political mudslinging or maybe
just hanging out on Facebook?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;When my father was writing letters to faceless, nameless people stuck
jobs answering IRS letters, he started with tiles like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PENALTY OR NO PLENALTY,
THAT IS THE QUESTION&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>There&#39;s a lot to be said for climbing mountains</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Vulgate (Latin): Matthew Chapter 5&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;1 Videns autem Jesus turbas, ascendit in montem...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;or, roughly (my translation):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34; data-lang=&#34;text&#34;&gt;Jesus, however, seeing the crowd/mob/political disturbance went up on
the mountain...
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The word &amp;ldquo;turba&amp;rdquo; per my paper dictionary tends towards a crowd that is
politically disturbed.  It can also mean an eddy (water) or a child&amp;rsquo;s
spinning top. Per &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/turba#Latin&#34;&gt;https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/turba#Latin&lt;/a&gt; it means&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Adding uncertainty in uncertain times</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/2020-06-30/</link>

      <description>So, when life turns uncertain you have two choices. Cling to things that seem to add stability and certainty, i.e. try to &amp;ldquo;stay safe&amp;rdquo;, or embrace the uncertainty, live now, carpe diem, and do things would seem to be fulfilling now.
I&amp;rsquo;m choosing the latter. At 58, in the middle of a pandemic and social unrest, I&amp;rsquo;m moving to a startup. The following are notes from a friend who has been playing the silicon valley startup game for a few decades.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Opening day [of baseball] in Cincinnati has always been a time of
hope and optimism, a time to look forward to, a time to enjoy
being with family and friends, a time to enjoy looking at the
forsythia and daffodils heralding spring, to walk across the Ohio
River on the Roebling bridge, to take in the annual Findlay
Market Parade, and to hear the umpire (or Marty and Joe on the
radio) say &amp;ldquo;Play Ball.&amp;rdquo;  I am declaring today my personal
&amp;ldquo;Opening Day 2020&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>Figure 1: Things on our mantle  What is this and who is it for? This is written primarily as a personal reflection to my cousin about us both winding up with tons of family &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;. Secondarily it is intended for a family newsletter. Tertiarily, for my sons to document snippets of family history, and lastly (quarternarily ?) it is written as an &amp;ldquo;open letter&amp;rdquo;.
To John John, you and I both have a lot of &amp;ldquo;family stuff&amp;rdquo;, for different reasons I think.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;And to get away from it all tonight we played (well, continued) a game
of Civilization: Famine, Strife, Civil War, Flood,
Earthquakes, Volcanoes, but strangely no epidemic (yet).&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting started in life is harder right now</title>

      <description>Getting started in life is harder right now. I have two college age sons who both just finished up their year with online classes, and both are home now. In &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; times they would be working summer jobs or participating in other activities that would help them advance toward their chosen careers. Jobs may or may not happen. Even getting out of the house may not happen much. These are weird times.</description>

      <title>Poetry in the trash</title>
      <link>https://eludom.github.io/blog/poetry-in-the-trash/</link>

      <guid>https://eludom.github.io/blog/poetry-in-the-trash/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A few years ago, my mother went through the effects of her cousin
after she died.  It turns out Thelma Jane wrote poetry.  Nobody knew.
It wound up in the trash.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thelma lived alone.  Her husband had died in his 40s.  They had no
children. Her mother, my great-aunt Bess, lived to 102 and took her
first motorcycle ride at 100.  My mom had to go through Thelma&amp;rsquo;s stuff
and Aunt Bess&amp;rsquo; stuff, most of which Thelma still had.  I now have some
of the leftovers.  But nobody wanted the poetry.  So it&amp;rsquo;s gone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This brings me to the question this article explores: &lt;em&gt;why write&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daniel Boone is quoted (via Hubert Humphrey) as saying&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when he could see the smoke from another chimney, felt himself too
crowded and moved further out into the wilderness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark Twain said&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>All is not doom and gloom: go for a walk !!!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I find that when I stay glued to twitter (pick your
social-media-of-doom-amplifier) I tend to get a rather gloomy view of
life.  There is indeed a lot one can be gloomy about these days.  But
if you just go for a walk and look around you may be
surprised:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found this art &lt;a href=&#34;#org52002ea&#34;&gt;sidewalk art&lt;/a&gt; at just about the exact place where last
fall I had purchased a cup of lemonade from 4 eager young
entrepreneurs.  I suspect the ring leader of that optimistic young
bunch.&lt;/p&gt;
