      <title>Things That Have Been Around The House for 220&#43; Years</title>

      <description>&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world has changed.
I see it in the water.
I feel it in the Earth.
I smell it in the air.
Much that once was is lost,
For none now live who remember it. ”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;― J. R. R. Tolkien&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life goes on, until it doesn&amp;rsquo;t.  Then those of us who are still here
are often left with the cherished collections of a generation, or two,
or three, or four, or&amp;hellip;  The oldest thing I think I have in the house
is this page torn out of a family bible (I have at least 3 of them,
big, old, once-cherished).  It records the death of a William Gould in
1792, and of Joseph Dennis Gould in 1835.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Getting started in life is harder right now</title>

      <description>Getting started in life is harder right now. I have two college age sons who both just finished up their year with online classes, and both are home now. In &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; times they would be working summer jobs or participating in other activities that would help them advance toward their chosen careers. Jobs may or may not happen. Even getting out of the house may not happen much. These are weird times.</description>
