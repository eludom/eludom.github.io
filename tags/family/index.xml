      <description>What is this and who is it for? This is written primarily as a personal reflection to my cousin about us both winding up with tons of family &amp;ldquo;stuff&amp;rdquo;. Secondarily it is intended for a family newsletter. Tertiarily, for my sons to document snippets of family history, and lastly (quarternarily ?) it is written as an &amp;ldquo;open letter&amp;rdquo;.
To John You and I both have a lot of &amp;ldquo;family stuff&amp;rdquo;, for different reasons I think.</description>

      <description>Getting started in life is harder right now. I have two college age sons who both just finished up their year with online classes, and both are home now. In &amp;ldquo;normal&amp;rdquo; times they would be working summer jobs or participating in other activities that would help them advance toward their chosen careers. Jobs may or may not happen. Even getting out of the house may not happen much. These are weird times.</description>
