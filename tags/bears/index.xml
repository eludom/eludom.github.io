      <description>I spend a good amount of time hiking in Shenandoah National Park and surrounding areas. I&amp;rsquo;ve seen quite a few #bears and I&amp;rsquo;ve followed one down the trail. I&amp;rsquo;ve been growled at by a mother bear when I unknowingly came between her and her cubs. This is going somewhere related to #cybersecurity. I promise.
You can&amp;rsquo;t outrun a bear. Climbing a tree won&amp;rsquo;t help. If a bear actually decides to attack you, the odds are not in your favor, but fortunately they almost never attack.</description>
